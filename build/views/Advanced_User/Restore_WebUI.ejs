You still "see" the camera inside your network and might even be able to access the video stream with our smartphone app. But your web browser simply refuses to open the interface. In this case the webUI was damaged during the installation process and all that needs to be done is updating it a second time. The easiest way to do this, is using the INSTAR Camera Tool, go to the Update tab and load the webUI file onto the camera. But what if this update also fails?</p><h2>Simple Update Tool HD</h2><p> You tried to update your HD camera´s software but everything you tried fails and you are no longer able to access the web user interface from your web browser?
