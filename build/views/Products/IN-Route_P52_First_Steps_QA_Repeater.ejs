In the following we will go through all of the three router modes that are here, for you too choose from. The Wireless Repeater mode allows you to bridge a distance between your WiFi router and the place where you actually need the WiFi network. You don´t have any WiFi in your favorite corner of your bed room ? Just put your IN-Route router half way between your router and that spot. The Repeater mode will catch the WiFi network from your internet router and amplify it for you.</p></div><div class="margin"><div><amp-img src="/images/IN-Route_P52_40en.png" width="1000" height="569" layout="responsive" class="shadow"></amp-img></div><p>Choose the WiFi Router symbol to configure the Repeater Mode of your IN-Route P52.</p></div><div class="margin"><div><amp-img src="/images/IN-Route_P52_41en.png" width="1000" height="568" layout="responsive" class="shadow"></amp-img></div><p>Use the scan button to discover all available WiFi networks in the area.
