In the following we will go through all of the three router modes that are here, for you too choose from. The <strong>DSL Router Mode</strong> allows you to use the IN-Route directly connected to the modem you received from your Internet Service Provider. You just have to type in the login credentials you received from your ISP and can enjoy internet access in no time at all. The second option is to connect your router to an existing network via a LAN cable and create an <strong>Access Point (AP)</strong> for your wireless devices that don´t have an Ethernet interface to plug in the cable. This comes in handy when you are staying in hotels that only offer internet access over LAN cables. Plug in your IN-Route and you are good to go to browse the net on your iPad.</p></div><div class="margin"><div><amp-img src="/images/IN-Route_P52_36en.png" width="1000" height="563" layout="responsive" class="shadow"></amp-img></div><p>Click on the router symbol to configure your IN-Route to either work as a DSL router behind a internet modem or to open a wireless AP for your mobile devices.</p></div><div class="margin"><div><amp-img src="/images/IN-Route_P52_37en.png" width="1000" height="564" layout="responsive" class="shadow"></amp-img></div><p>Choose between the ADSL Router mode and the Wireless AP mode.</p></div><div class="margin"><div><amp-img src="/images/IN-Route_P52_38en.png" width="1000" height="563" layout="responsive" class="shadow"></amp-img></div><p>To use the router directly behind your internet modem, please type in the login credentials you received from your internet service provider.</p></div><div class="margin"><div><amp-img src="/images/IN-Route_P52_39en.png" width="1000" height="563" layout="responsive" class="shadow"></amp-img></div><p>The wireless AP mode only needs you to set up a DHCP hostname for your IN-Route.
