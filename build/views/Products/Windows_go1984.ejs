Go to Video/Properties (see Screenshots in the chapter above) to select a stream appropriated for your network environment. E.g. for HD cameras set the parameter Uri from 11 (high quality) to 12 (medium quality) or 13 (low bandwidth). If you are using the MJPEG stream of your HD camera, set it´s -chn from 11 to 12 or 13 respectively. You can also adjust the video parameter inside the camera´s web user interface to fit your needs.</p></div><div class="margin"><h3>Motion Detection</h3><br><amp-img on="tap:lightbox9" role="button" tabindex="0" src="/images/Go1984_07.png" width="800" height="574" layout="responsive" class="shadow"></amp-img><amp-image-lightbox id="lightbox9" layout="nodisplay"></amp-image-lightbox><br><p class="justify">go1984 includes high-performance motion detection based on an optimized image difference process. When motion detection is triggered, the so-called "Motion" signal is activated for this camera. This signal can be used, for instance, to begin recording, to launch an FTP upload or to trigger an alarm. Motion areas are highlighted in the live image with red squares. As soon as the actual value exceeds the specified threshold, the motion signal is triggered. The specified threshold (yellow) and current actual value (green or red) are graphically represented by two colored bars in the program to make adjustments easier for you. The actual value bar changes from green to red if a motion has been detected. The circle in the "Motion" field also turns red.</p><p class="justify">You'll be shown the live image from the camera, with motion areas being marked by red rectangles. As soon as the actual value surpasses the specified limit value, the motion signal is triggered. The specified limit value (yellow) and the current actual value (green or red) are graphically represented by two colored bars in the program in order to make adjustment easier for you. The actual value bar changes from green to red if a motion has been detected. The circle in the "Motion" field also lights up in red.</p><p class="justify">It often makes sense to exclude certain areas of the camera image from motion detection. In order to do so, you can draw any kind of mask over the image. Various tools are available for doing so. The mask is displayed on the screen transparently for control purposes. Grayed out areas will be excluded from now on.</p></div><div class="margin"><amp-img on="tap:lightbox10" role="button" tabindex="0" src="/images/Go1984_07.png" width="800" height="574" layout="responsive" class="shadow"></amp-img><amp-image-lightbox id="lightbox10" layout="nodisplay"></amp-image-lightbox><br><p class="justify">For normal purposes, motion detection settings do not need to be adjusted more than described above. If the default values don't work perfectly for your needs, you'll find additional setup options on the "Properties" tab. Please check your go1984 user manual for more details.</p></div><div class="margin"><h3>Storage Management</h3><br><amp-img on="tap:lightbox11" role="button" tabindex="0" src="/images/Go1984_09.png" width="800" height="571" layout="responsive" class="shadow"></amp-img><amp-image-lightbox id="lightbox11" layout="nodisplay"></amp-image-lightbox><br><p class="justify">go1984 includes efficient ring storage. This enables you to optimize available hard-drive space allocation to the cameras, thereby ensuring that there is always enough memory space available for new recordings. go1984 is able to delete the oldest recordings automatically after the allotted memory has been used up.
