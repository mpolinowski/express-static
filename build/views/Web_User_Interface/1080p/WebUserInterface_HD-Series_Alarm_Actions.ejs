The disadvantage is that the detection does not discriminate causes for changes inside the cameras field of view - a cloud moving by in front of the sun, raindrops or vegetation moving in the wind. Everything can cause an alarm. Please activate the integrated Passive Infrared Sensor and link it with the software based detection to minimize false alerts.</p></div><div class="margin"><div><amp-img srcset="/images/1080p_webUI/1080p_Settings_Alarm_Actions.jpg 100w, /images/1080p_webUI/1080p_Settings_Alarm_Actions.png 1500w" width="1371" height="949" layout="responsive" class="shadow" on="tap:alarmActions" role="button" tabindex="0"></amp-img></div></div><div class="margin"><table><tr><td width="20%"> <strong>Send Email</strong></td><td>All alarm actions can be triggerd by the <a href="/Web_User_Interface/1080p_Series/Alarm/Areas/">motion detection areas</a>, the alarm input as well as the audio alarm.

Information about connecting an extern sensor can be found <a href="/Products/IN-Motion/500/Wiring/">here</a>. You can connect every sensor to your camera that is operated via a potential free contact.</td></tr><tr><td width="20%"> <strong>Electric circuit during alarm / Alarm device set to</strong></td><td>Set if your external sensor is configured to close the circuit in case of a detection or if it will open the contact (see also <a href="/Products/IN-Motion/500/">IN-Motion 500</a>). Please be aware that your camera will be in a constant state of alarm, if you set the alarm input to N.C. and you don´t connect an external sensor. (This can be used to test your Alarm Settings)</td></tr><tr><td width="20%"> <strong>Link alarm input with alarm areas</strong></td><td>It is recommended to couple the <a href="/Web_User_Interface/1080p_Series/Alarm/Areas/">internal motion detection</a> with the external sensor. Please be aware, that you have to have at least one detection area active, when using the coupled state.</td></tr><tr><td width="20%"> <strong>Activate internal PIR sensor</strong></td><td>Activate the internal passive infrared sensor (PIR Motion Detector) to trigger an alert once a person enters the surveillance area (not available in all models). You can deactivate the <a href="/Web_User_Interface/1080p_Series/Alarm/Areas/">alarm areas</a> once the PIR sensor is active. But in most cases it is recommended to couple the <a href="/Web_User_Interface/1080p_Series/Alarm/Areas/">internal motion detection</a> with the PIR sensor.</td></tr><tr><td width="20%"> <strong>Link PIR and motion detect areas</strong></td><td>You can also couple the <a href="/Web_User_Interface/1080p_Series/Alarm/Areas/">alarm areas</a> with the internal PIR sensor. Use this function to effectively screen out false alerts. Please be aware, that you have to at least activate one of the alarm areas to use this function! You also have to press both the <a href="/Software/iOS/InstarVision/iPhone/Multiview/">Eye Symbol</a> as well as the <a href="/Software/iOS/InstarVision/iPhone/Multiview/">Burglar Symbol</a> in our smartphone app to activate/deactivate the alarm.</td></tr></table></div><div class="margin"><h3>Use an external Sensor</h3><p>You can use a motion detector like the <a href="/Products/IN-Motion/">IN-Motion 500</a> to improve the detection rate of your camera (Only cameras with an Alarm-In contact) if your camera does not yet come with a PIR motion sensor equipped like the IN-8015 HD. Simply <a href="/Products/IN-Motion/500/Wiring/">connect the sensor</a> to the alarm input and activate the external input. The camera will trigger an alarm when the pins 3&amp;4 are bridged and the relay state is set to closed on alarm (n.o. “Normally Open”). If it is set to open on alarm, the alarm will be triggered once the circuit is broken by the relay inside the detector (n.c. “Normally Closed”) or if the wire is disconnected. The state you have to choose depends on your sensor - the wrong choice will give a continuous alert once the detector is connected.</p></div><div class="dangercard"><p><strong><u>Remark:</u></strong><br/><br/>When you are using an external sensor (or the internal PIR sensor in case of the IN-8015 HD), then you have to either deactivate the internal motion detection (Alarm Areas) or have to couple it with the Alarm Input! The alarm cannot be triggered otherwise.<br/><br/>Once you linked both detection methods, you always have to deactivate <u>both</u> to deactivate the motion detection!</p></div><div class="margin"><h3>Use the internal Sensor (<strong>e.g. IN-8015 HD</strong>)</h3><p>Activating the internal or external PIR sensor allows you to limit the motion detection to bodies whose temperature differs from the background. In most cases, this will be a person or animal in front of the cameras or the warm engine of a car. Changes in light conditions, fog in front of the camera at night or movements in the wind will not be detected by the PIR sensor.<br/><br/>By coupling the PIR sensor with the detection areas, you will only get an alarm event if both detection methods were triggered at the same time. This will greatly reduce the number of false alerts you might have. But be aware that it also might eliminate a few positive alerts.</p></div><div class="margin"><h3>Switch external devices in case of an alarm (or manually)</h3><p>The external output connects to a relay inside the camera that can be switched manually or automatically in case of an alarm event. Please check Activate Alarm Output to let the camera open or close a circuit with an external device connected to the pins 1&amp;2. The external output can be used with the cameras motion detection to activate signalling devices like sirens or LED lights. It can also be used to control connected devices manually, e.g. via our smartphone app. The relay can be connected to circuits with up to 60 V direct current / 125 V alternating current and max. 1 A.</p></div><div class="clearfix mb mt"></div></article> <!-- ################# Lightbox ##################### --><amp-lightbox id="alarmActions" layout="nodisplay"><div class="lightbox"><amp-img src="/images/1080p_webUI/1080p_Settings_Alarm_Actions.jpg" width="800" height="550" on="tap:alarmActions.close" role="button" tabindex="1"></div></amp-lightbox></div></div> <% include ../../_partials/content/_bluenav-general-mobile.ejs %><footer> <% include ../../_partials/amp/_amp-footer.ejs %></footer></body></html>
