Now move your mouse cursor over the image and draw the detection area onto the canvas by holding your left mouse button. To add another area select the corresponding radio button and repeat the steps above. Those areas tell your camera where to search for motion. Everything that is not covered by an area will be ignored by the motion detection function.</td></tr><tr><td width="20%"> <strong>Active</strong></td><td>Click the Activate button to activate the motion detection for the corresponding area. Inactive areas will be displayed in white. Active areas will be displayed in their corresponding colour - Red, Blue, Green or Yellow. A motion detection inside an active area will trigger all activated <a href="/Web_User_Interface/1080p_Series/Alarm/Actions/">Alarm Actions</a>. You can quickly activate / deactivate the motion detection of your camera using our <a href="/Software/iOS/InstarVision/iPhone/Multiview">iPhone</a>, <a href="/Software/iOS/InstarVision/iPad/Multiview">iPad</a>, <a href="/Software/Android/InstarVision/Multiview">Android</a> or <a href="/Software/Windows/InstarVision/Windows_Phone/Multiview">Windows Phone</a> App - just click the button with the burglar symbol (red = active).</td></tr><tr><td width="20%"> <strong>Sensitivity</strong></td><td>Set a threshold for the motion detection function. With a higher sensitivity less pixel inside the video frame have to change to cause an alert and trigger your programmed <a href="/Web_User_Interface/1080p_Series/Alarm/Actions/">Alarm Actions</a>. But be aware that the sensitivity also depends on the size of your detection area. A small area is always more sensitive than a big area. Adjust your sensitivity and area size accordingly to prevent false or missed alerts.</td></tr><tr><td width="20%"> <strong>All</strong></td><td>Click on the All button to cover the whole image with your selected area.</td></tr><tr><td width="20%"> <strong>Reset</strong></td><td>Move all areas back to their default corner position.</td></tr></table></div><div class="margin"><h3>Potential Errors</h3><p>In case the camera’s position is prone to rapid light changes, e.g. changes in sun intensity due to cloud movements, you might be confronted with a high number of false alarms.

Small areas are a lot more sensitive and should be used over parts of the image, where you never want to miss someone walking through. But they also lead to a large number of false alerts und should be used sparsely. You will receive a lot of false alarm notifications in the example above.</p></div><div class="secondarycard"><h4>Right</h4><p>One big Area - small Areas only where they are critical</p><amp-img src="/images/1080p_webUI/1080p_Settings_Alarm_Areas_correct.png" width="887" height="503" layout="responsive" class="shadow"></amp-img><p>A big area is - according to the explanation above - much more resistent against false alerts. A big area over the whole image will only trigger an alert when a person comes very close to the camera. You can use a slightly higher sensitivity to compensate.<br/><br/> To prevent that you might loose actual alarm events, add a smaller area where it is critical - e.g. a window or your front door.<br/><br/> The smaller this area is is, the higher it´s sensitivity. To find the optimal setting, keep an eye on your camera´s <a href="/Web_User_Interface/1080p_Series/System/Log/">System Log</a>. If an area cause too many false alerts, make it bigger or decrease it´s sensitivity.</p></div></article> <!-- ################# Lightbox ##################### --><amp-lightbox id="alarmAreas" layout="nodisplay"><div class="lightbox"><amp-img src="/images/1080p_webUI/1080p_Settings_Alarm_Areas.png" width="800" height="550" on="tap:alarmAreas.close" role="button" tabindex="1"></div></amp-lightbox></div></div> <% include ../../_partials/content/_bluenav-general-mobile.ejs %><footer> <% include ../../_partials/amp/_amp-footer.ejs %></footer></body></html>
