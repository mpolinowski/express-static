You can also use devices inside your LAN for this function, e.g. a <a href="/Motion_Detection/FTP_Server_Setup">local server</a> or maybe your <a href="/Motion_Detection/Router_as_a_FTP_Server">Router or NAS</a>.</td></tr><tr><td width="20%"> <strong>FTP Port</strong></td><td>The default port for the FTP service is <strong>Port 21</strong>. Adjust this port here, if your configured your server differently.</td></tr><tr><td width="20%"> <strong>Modus</strong></td><td>You can use the passive mode (PASV) in most cases.

This might happen if your FTP server is by an NAT firewall.</td></tr><tr><td width="20%"> <strong>Storage path</strong></td><td>The FTP directory - the folder that your camera will use to upload images and videos to - is always relative to the root directory of your FTP User! The root directory for each user is defined on your FTP server - read our AVM Fritzbox manual for an example.</td></tr><tr><td width="20%"> <strong>Directory structure</strong></td><td>If you want to upload a large number of files to the FTP server, it is recommended to create a new folder for those uploads each day. With some systems you might run into some problems with this setting.

E.g. you can use your routers FTP service as FTP Server - in this case simply put in your routers IP as the FTP Server address. If you set up a FTP server on a local PC (for example with Filezilla Server), use the PC’s local IP address. Of course you can use webservers URL’s as well. The standard <strong>FTP port is 21</strong>.<br/><br/> You can define an upload directory for your camera under FTP Folder. The root folder of the FTP server can be reached by <strong>./</strong>. The separator for the folders is the forward slash. A subfolder (e.g. INSTAR) can be reached by <strong>./INSTAR</strong>. An ending forward slash is not obligatory, but can be used.<br/><br/> The FTP Username and FTP Password are the login credentials for your FTP Account.<br/><br/> The name of the video file is fixed and corresponds to the following syntax: <em>rec011_YYYYMMDDhhmmss.asf</em>. The first part shows the channel that was used for the recording - 11, 12 or 13. Separated by an underscore follows a timestamp, which marks the time of the motion detection.</p></div><div class="margin"><h3>Passive or Port</h3><p>For the FTP Mode you can choose between a passive (<strong>PASV</strong>) and an active mode (<strong>PORT</strong>). The standard is the active PASV mode. If your server is installed behind a router with an active network address translation (NAT), or if a firewall is blocking the servers network from an external access by your camera, you should choose the PORT mode.</p></div><div class="clearfix margin"></div></article> <!-- #################### Lightboxes ######################## --><amp-lightbox id="netFTP" layout="nodisplay"><div class="lightbox"><amp-img src="/images/1080p_webUI/1080p_Settings_Network_FTP.jpg" width="800" height="550" on="tap:netFTP.close" role="button" tabindex="1"></div></amp-lightbox></div></div> <% include ../../_partials/content/_bluenav-general-mobile.ejs %><footer> <% include ../../_partials/amp/_amp-footer.ejs %></footer></body></html>
