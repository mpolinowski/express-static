To access the interface, please charge your router, switch it into WiFi mode and connect to it´s WiFi network. For more details please follow the instructions for the <a href="/Products/IN-Route/First_Steps/Login">router login</a>. To follow this article, please make sure that your router´s webUI is switched to the Advanced Mode - the Simple Mode will not contain all the options we are covering here. Please be also aware that what we are doing here can be considered an advanced configuration. In most cases you will be fine just following the <a href="/Products/IN-Route/First_Steps">First Steps Configuration</a> discussed earlier.
