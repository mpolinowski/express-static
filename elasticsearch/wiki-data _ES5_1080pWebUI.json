    "description": "System Menu - Info is simply a collection of a lot of system internals that are interesting if you have to start troubleshooting your set up. You DDNS access doesn´t work? Check the DDNS status (has to be successful) and the UPnP Status (most likely has to be deactivated). You can also try accessing your camera via it´s WAN IP (instead of DDNS address) - to check wether it is the DDNS address or your port forwarding that is the culprit. Here you need to input the sender, the receivers, the subject as well as optional a short email text with a maximum 64 characters. The sender address should be in accordance with the SMTP server settings, though some email provider let you choose this field freely. If you want to send the email to more than one address, simply separate the addresses with a semicolon ;. E.g. max.mustermann@instar.de ; franz.fingerhut@instar.de. It is recommended to fill out the subject line and the email text body to avoid the mail to be caught by any spam guards in place. Your camera will be set up with 3 user classes - administrator, user and visitor - and one password for all of them - instar. Please change this as soon as you want to forward your camera to the internet. And don´t forget to change all three of them. You can use the RTSP Stream if you want to allow users to access your camera without the hassle of a password. Your camera will automatically contact a so-called NTP Server to set the internal clock. It is recommended to leave this feature on at all times. But if your camera cannot connect to the internet, you can synchronize the clock with your computer. But be aware that this has to be done regularly to keep your camera on-time. Change the language of the web user interface to German, English, French or Chinese. The user interface automatically sets the language according to the language of your operating system. You can manually change it, if the auto-detection fails or you want the UI to be displayed in different languages on different computers. Your selection will be saved locally as a cookie and not globally on your camera. Something doesn´t work anymore? Check the system log file for information. You don´t receive Alarm Emails anymore but your SMTP settings look fine? Check the log if there are still motion trigger events. Or you get spammed with Alarm Emails but motion detection is already deactivated? Check your log - maybe the events are triggered by the Audio Alarm or an external trigger. The INSTAR software department is constantly working to improve your experience with our product. You can check the update section from time to time to make sure your system is still up-to-date. You can also check our DOWNLOAD AREA to find our newest software and corresponding changelogs. Use this function to reboot or reset your camera safely. It is not recommended to simply unplug/replug your camera or use the hardware reset unnecessarily (those actions can be harmful to running operations as well as causing hardware defects on the internal SD card). Please always use the soft- restart and reset via the web user interface. Use the hardware reset in case that you have lost access to the interface.

Or use the scan results to check the signal strenght at the camera´s installation spot. WIFI MENU You have two ways to access your camera over the internet - the easy way is called. The only way to get complete access to all your camera´s functions is called DDNS. The DDNS or Internet Address gives you access to your cameras web user interface. REMOTE ACCESS To use the video FTP Upload you first have to set your ftp server address and login credentials. E.g. you can use your routers FTP service as FTP Server - in this case simply put in your routers IP as the FTP Server address. If you set up a FTP server on a local PC (for example with Filezilla Server), use the PC’s local IP address. Of course you can use webservers URL’s as well. The standard FTP port is 21.

This would make the DDNS ACCESS to your camera very easy...unfortunately it often does not work and might be considered a security hazard by your network administrator. Please deactivate UPnP if you are working with a manually forwarded port for your camera.

Please check here on how to set a fixed IP address. In general, we recommend that you deactivate the automatic service and set a manual IP to avoid further trouble with the remote access to your camera. For the RTSP Port please refer to RTSP Streaming for details on the use of the camera´s RTSP videostream. Remember to forward the RTSP Port if you want to access the RTSP Stream over the internet with your DDNS Address. The RTMP Port is used by the Flash plugin in your camera´s web user interface. Remember to forward the RTMP Port (alongside your LAN Port!) if you want to access the web user interface over the internet with your DDNS Address. IP address This is the IPv4 address of your camera isnide your local network. To access your camera´s web user interface, simply type in the IP address into the address bar of web browser. If your camera´s LAN port is not 80, please add the port to the IP address seperated by a : , like 192.168.1.125:8081. Subnetmask The subnet mask defines the subnet your camera is connected to. It is 255.255.255.0 in most small networks. Gateway The gateway is the connection between your local network and the internet. In most small networks it is the IP address of your router - e.g. 192.168.1.1, 192.168.2.1 or 192.168.178.1. DNS Server The DNS server is needed by your camera to resolve internet addresses. In most small networks it is the IP address of your router - e.g. 192.168.1.1, 192.168.2.1 or 192.168.178.1. LAN Port The LAN Port is the HTTP Port of your camera. Add this port to your camera´s IP address, if you want to access the web user interface with your web browser. This is also the port that you need to forward inside your router, to access your camera via it´s DDNS Address. We recommend that you use a HTTP port that is higher then 8080.

Select your WiFi from the list below, add your WiFi key and Submit. After confirmation, simply unplug the Ethernet cable and your camera will connect to the WiFi network. Alternatively, type in the network parameter manually. See our Installation Wizard for further information for the WPS function. SSID Name of your WiFi network. If you use more then one access points (APs) in your network, it is recommended to assign unique SSIDs to each of them. This way you can bind your camera to the AP that offers the best connection. Network Type Choose if you want to connect your camera directly to another network device (ad hoc). Or if you want to add it to the local WiFi network of your wireless router (infra). Encryption Set the type of encryption to the same encryption that your router is using. We recommend to set your WiFi router to use the WPA2 with AES standard. In case of an AVM Fritzbox, select CCMP and couple it with AES type (see below) inside your camera. Type Choose the encryption standard that your router is using. We recommend that you set your router to use pure WPA2 (AES or CCMP) and not WPA+WPA2 (TKIP). Password Here you need to add the WiFi key that you use to connect devices to your local wireless network. The WiFi can sometimes be found on a sticker directly on the router itself. If you cannot use the WPS service (Wireless Portected Setup) to integrate the camera into you local WiFi network - see our Installation Wizard for further information for the WPS function - click search to start the WLAN scanner. Just choose your own network and click “Join”. Now you just have to add the WiFi password (WLAN Key) and click submit to save the settings. Afterwards you can use the Test function to verify your settings. Please disconnect the LAN cable and restart the camera (simply unplug the power supply for 3 seconds). The camera will automatically - within max. 5 minutes - connect to your WiFi network. The cameras WiFi module will receive a new address from your router - in case you didn’t assign a static IP address to your camera yet. You might have to use the INSTAR Camera Tool again to rediscover your camera. Your camera is now connected via WiFi! Attention Your WiFi modules MAC address is not identical with the LAN MAC address of your camera! In case you are using a MAC filtering rule for your WiFi network please deactivate the filter and add your camera to the list of trusted devices before reactivating it. Additional Remark Your camera supports a range of encryption standards - we recommend for your safety and reliability of your connection, that you set your WiFi network to WPA2 (PSK) with AES (or CCMP). With older routers choose WPA (PSK) / AES. Avoid using a mixed mode like WPA&WPA2 - TKIP! If your WiFi stays unstable please choose a fixed WiFi channel for your router - we recommend the channels 1 - 6.",

Use third-party DDNS If you don´t want to use your INSTAR DDNS Address, just add a Thirdparty DDNS Address. Please contact your Third-party provider for details. If you want to deactivate your INSTAR DDNS Address, simply activate the third-party address (remember that you have to wait until your internet provider changes your WAN IP address to see the effect - usually happens every 24h). Be Aware Your camera will be accessible for everyone after you forwarded it inside your router. To prevent unwanted access, please make sure to change the user logins before you start forwarding the camera! The user logins can be adjusted in the User Menu. In case you want to use an account from DynDNS simply choose the third party service and type in your personal login credentials. By doing so you will temporarily deactivate your INSTAR DDNS address. In case you are using several cameras behind a single internet access point, please set up the third party address in only one of the cameras. Or if possible directly inside your router! All your cameras will be accessible through this address - just assign a unique HTTP port to every camera. For example if camera 1 is assigned the HTTP port 8081 and camera 2 the HTTP port 8082, use myaddress.dyndns.org:8081 to reach camera 1 and myaddresse.dyndns.org:8082 to be forwarded to camera 2.",

You can also use devices inside your LAN for this function, e.g. a local server or maybe your Router or NAS. FTP Port The default port for the FTP service is Port 21. Adjust this port here, if your configured your server differently. Modus You can use the passive mode (PASV) in most cases. Only choose PORT mode if PASV fails. This might happen if your FTP server is by an NAT firewall. Storage path The FTP directory - the folder that your camera will use to upload images and videos to - is always relative to the root directory of your FTP User! The root directory for each user is defined on your FTP server - read our AVM Fritzbox manual for an example. Directory structure If you want to upload a large number of files to the FTP server, it is recommended to create a new folder for those uploads each day. With some systems you might run into some problems with this setting. In this case try to upload all files to one folder instead. FTP Username The username - and it´s access rights - are defined on your FTP server. Type in the username you want your camera to use here. FTP Password Add the corresponding password here. Test The test function will try to upload a file to your FTP server - the name of the file consists of the capital letter T and a Timestamp. Don´t forget to submit your settings first before using the Test Function! FTP Server Upload To use the video FTP Upload you first have to set your ftp server address and login credentials. E.g. you can use your routers FTP service as FTP Server - in this case simply put in your routers IP as the FTP Server address. If you set up a FTP server on a local PC (for example with Filezilla Server), use the PC’s local IP address. Of course you can use webservers URL’s as well. The standard FTP port is 21. You can define an upload directory for your camera under FTP Folder. The root folder of the FTP server can be reached by ./. The separator for the folders is the forward slash. A subfolder (e.g. INSTAR) can be reached by ./INSTAR. An ending forward slash is not obligatory, but can be used. The FTP Username and FTP Password are the login credentials for your FTP Account. The name of the video file is fixed and corresponds to the following syntax: rec011_YYYYMMDDhhmmss.asf. The first part shows the channel that was used for the recording - 11, 12 or 13. Separated by an underscore follows a timestamp, which marks the time of the motion detection. Passive or Port For the FTP Mode you can choose between a passive (PASV) and an active mode (PORT). The standard is the active PASV mode. If your server is installed behind a router with an active network address translation (NAT), or if a firewall is blocking the servers network from an external access by your camera, you should choose the PORT mode.",

Please be adviced that high quality settings come with high requirements for your computer hardware and network bandwidth. Adjust the video quality to obtain a fluent video accordingly. Please refer to RTSP Streaming for accessing the cameras streams 2 and 3. Video resolution Your camera can send it´s h.264 video in form of three different streams, with different resolution. You can access all three of them independently with external software. Selecting a stream here defines which stream is displayed inside the web user interface. Image refresh rate (fps) This value represents the frames per seconds in your camera´s videostream. Please be aware that this is only a theoretical maximum that you don´t want your camera to exceed. The actual framerate might be bottlenecked by your camera´s network connection and the exposure time of the image sensor (the darker the image becomes, the longer the image sensor has to collect light and the longer it takes to create a frame). The framerate is suitable to set an upper limit to the bandwidth requirement of your camera, to prevent a network overload. The default value of 15 fps is usually a workable compromise for most surveillance tasks. Variable fps Allow your camera to reduce it´s frame rate when a high frame rate is not needed. This can drastically reduce the required bandwith. Video bitrate The bitrate determines how many information can be packed into the video stream. Increasing the bitrate will massively increase the bandwidth requirements for accessing the stream over the local network and will also increase the file size of recorded videos. A significant advantage in image quality will only be achieved, if the video contains a lot of fine details. In most cases it is recommended to leave this value at it´s default of 2048kbps. Variable bitrate You can adjust if you want to hold the set bitrate, or if you want your camera to automatically use a lower bitrate if the video is low in details (e.g. your camera can often work with a much lower bitrate during the night). This will effect the file size of recorded videos, the processor load of your camera, as well as the bandwidth requirements of the live stream. We recommend that you use the variable Bitrate. Keyframe interval A key frame (I-Frame) is a frame encoded in its entirety, much like a JPEG image. P-frames are predicted, ie, they contain only the changes from frame to frame. Hence I frames are typically 10x larger than P frames, so the fewer you have, the more compression you can get. As a compromise between image quality and bandwidth requirement, it is recommended to create about 1 keyframe every second. With the default intervall of 20 frames and a framerate of 15fps, your camera will send an I-Frame every (20 Frames/15 Frames/s) = 1.33s. h.264 Video Plugin Here you can choose the video plugin the web user interface uses to diplay the h.264 videostream. The default plugin is Flash. The ActiveX Player can be chooses alternatively. In general we recommend the use of the Flash Plugin. MotionJPEG Video Mode Your camera is able to send the video, instead of an h.264 encoded stream, in form of a sequence of single snapshots. This Motion-JPEG Stream has the advantage, that it can be displayed in every web browser without the need for a video plugin. This is necessary if you want to see the live video on a computer where you don´t have the rights to install a browser plugin, e.g. your company PC. The disadvantage of this mode is that the compression is a lot weaker and you will need a lot more bandwidth. If you are using the MJPEG stream, you can choose between two modes - a real MJPEG Stream (recommended) and a simulated Stream that is created by letting your browser request a new snapshot for each frame. I am not sure what the latter is for - but it is always nice to have it :)",

You can setup up to 4 detection areas - just activate an area and draw it’s shape onto the image - adjusts it´s sensitivity to set a threshold for trigger events. Areas Select the Area that you want to adjust (1-4) by clicking the Select radio button. Now move your mouse cursor over the image and draw the detection area onto the canvas by holding your left mouse button. To add another area select the corresponding radio button and repeat the steps above. Those areas tell your camera where to search for motion. Everything that is not covered by an area will be ignored by the motion detection function. Active Click the Activate button to activate the motion detection for the corresponding area. Inactive areas will be displayed in white. Active areas will be displayed in their corresponding colour - Red, Blue, Green or Yellow. A motion detection inside an active area will trigger all activated Alarm Actions. You can quickly activate / deactivate the motion detection of your camera using our iPhone, iPad, Android or Windows Phone App - just click the button with the burglar symbol (red = active). Sensitivity Set a threshold for the motion detection function. With a higher sensitivity less pixel inside the video frame have to change to cause an alert and trigger your programmed Alarm Actions. But be aware that the sensitivity also depends on the size of your detection area. A small area is always more sensitive than a big area. Adjust your sensitivity and area size accordingly to prevent false or missed alerts. All Click on the All button to cover the whole image with your selected area. Reset Move all areas back to their default corner position. Potential Errors In case the camera’s position is prone to rapid light changes, e.g. changes in sun intensity due to cloud movements, you might be confronted with a high number of false alarms. In this case please refer to Actions Menu for employing a PIR motion detector.. Wrong Many small Alarm Areas distributed over the Frame The smaller an area, the bigger (in percent) a change in the image will be. Small areas are a lot more sensitive and should be used over parts of the image, where you never want to miss someone walking through. But they also lead to a large number of false alerts und should be used sparsely. You will receive a lot of false alarm notifications in the example above. Right One big Area - small Areas only where they are critical A big area is - according to the explanation above - much more resistent against false alerts. A big area over the whole image will only trigger an alert when a person comes very close to the camera. You can use a slightly higher sensitivity to compensate. To prevent that you might loose actual alarm events, add a smaller area where it is critical - e.g. a window or your front door. The smaller this area is is, the higher it´s sensitivity. To find the optimal setting, keep an eye on your camera´s System Log. If an area cause too many false alerts, make it bigger or decrease it´s sensitivity.",

    "description": "Set what your Camera should do in Case of an Alert What do you want the Camera to do in Case of an Alarm Adjust the cameras behaviour in case of a motion alert trigger event. You can set the camera to send you an email and to save snapshots or videos on your SD card. Please make sure you set your SMTP Server settings before activating the email notification and that you have a SD card in your cameras SDHC card slot (max. 32 GB) to use the alarm and planned recording - a 4 GB SD card is included in the delivery. Software-based Motion Detection The software-based motion detection used by your camera for the activated Alarm Areas does not need any additional hardware to work and can be very precise in controlled indoor environments. The disadvantage is that the detection does not discriminate causes for changes inside the cameras field of view - a cloud moving by in front of the sun, raindrops or vegetation moving in the wind. Everything can cause an alarm. Please activate the integrated Passive Infrared Sensor and link it with the software based detection to minimize false alerts. Send Email All alarm actions can be triggerd by the motion detection areas, the alarm input as well as the audio alarm. Here you can activate the alarm notification by email in case of a trigger event. Please be aware, that you first have to set your outgoing mail server (SMTP) and email receiver before using this function. Save recording on SD Card Activate to save a video on the internal SD Card in case of an alarm. An alarm video file name always starts with an A and continuous with a time stamp. Your camera always records 3 seconds before the alarm event and 15 seconds after the trigger. A new 15s video will be started directly afterwards, if the motion continues. Transfer Recordings via FTP Activate sending a video to your FTP server after an alarm trigger. Please be aware, that you first have to set your FTP Server Information. Save Snapshot on SD Activate saving snapshots to the internal SD card in case of an alarm. Transfer Snapshot via FTP Activate sending snapshots to your FTP server in case of an alarm. Please be aware, that you first have to set your FTP information in the FTP menu. Snapshot Resolution Set the resolution used for the snapshots uploaded to FTP, Email or saved to SD card in case of an alarm. Number of Snapshots (email) Set how many snapshots you want to be attached to an alarm email. Please be aware, that the email might be delayed if you attach too many images. If you want to be notified without a delay, please use the Push Service. Number of Snapshots (SD) Set how many images you want to be saved to SD card in case of an alarm trigger. Number of Snapshots (FTP) Set how many images you want your camera to send to your FTP server in case of an alarm. Play Alarm Signal Set if you want your camera to play an alarm signal in case of an alarm. And please dont use it in combination with the Audio Alarm (below) :). Activate Audio Alarm Let your camera listen to noises. This is the ideal function to use your camera as a babyphone. Sensitivity Adjust how sensitive the audio detection should be. Activate Alarm Output Activate your cameras alarm output (not all camera models), and let your camera close the relay in case of an alarm. Output Duration Set for how long the alarm output relay should be closed in case of an alarm. Activate Alarm Input Activate your camera´s alarm input (not all camera models). Information about connecting an extern sensor can be found here. You can connect every sensor to your camera that is operated via a potential free contact. Electric circuit during alarm / Alarm device set to Set if your external sensor is configured to close the circuit in case of a detection or if it will open the contact (see also IN-Motion 500). Please be aware that your camera will be in a constant state of alarm, if you set the alarm input to N.C. and you don´t connect an external sensor. (This can be used to test your Alarm Settings) Link alarm input with alarm areas It is recommended to couple the internal motion detection with the external sensor. Please be aware, that you have to have at least one detection area active, when using the coupled state. Activate internal PIR sensor Activate the internal passive infrared sensor (PIR Motion Detector) to trigger an alert once a person enters the surveillance area (not available in all models). You can deactivate the alarm areas once the PIR sensor is active. But in most cases it is recommended to couple the internal motion detection with the PIR sensor. Link PIR and motion detect areas You can also couple the alarm areas with the internal PIR sensor. Use this function to effectively screen out false alerts. Please be aware, that you have to at least activate one of the alarm areas to use this function! You also have to press both the Eye Symbol as well as the Burglar Symbol in our smartphone app to activate/deactivate the alarm. Use an external Sensor You can use a motion detector like the IN-Motion 500 to improve the detection rate of your camera (Only cameras with an Alarm-In contact) if your camera does not yet come with a PIR motion sensor equipped like the IN-8015 HD. Simply connect the sensor to the alarm input and activate the external input. The camera will trigger an alarm when the pins 3&4 are bridged and the relay state is set to closed on alarm (n.o. “Normally Open”). If it is set to open on alarm, the alarm will be triggered once the circuit is broken by the relay inside the detector (n.c. “Normally Closed”) or if the wire is disconnected. The state you have to choose depends on your sensor - the wrong choice will give a continuous alert once the detector is connected. Remark: When you are using an external sensor (or the internal PIR sensor in case of the IN-8015 HD), then you have to either deactivate the internal motion detection (Alarm Areas) or have to couple it with the Alarm Input! The alarm cannot be triggered otherwise. Once you linked both detection methods, you always have to deactivate both to deactivate the motion detection! Use the internal Sensor (e.g. IN-8015 HD) Activating the internal or external PIR sensor allows you to limit the motion detection to bodies whose temperature differs from the background. In most cases, this will be a person or animal in front of the cameras or the warm engine of a car. Changes in light conditions, fog in front of the camera at night or movements in the wind will not be detected by the PIR sensor. By coupling the PIR sensor with the detection areas, you will only get an alarm event if both detection methods were triggered at the same time. This will greatly reduce the number of false alerts you might have. But be aware that it also might eliminate a few positive alerts. Switch external devices in case of an alarm (or manually) The external output connects to a relay inside the camera that can be switched manually or automatically in case of an alarm event. Please check Activate Alarm Output to let the camera open or close a circuit with an external device connected to the pins 1&2. The external output can be used with the cameras motion detection to activate signalling devices like sirens or LED lights. It can also be used to control connected devices manually, e.g. via our smartphone app. The relay can be connected to circuits with up to 60 V direct current / 125 V alternating current and max. 1 A.",
