The only way to get complete access to all your camera´s functions is called DDNS. The DDNS or Internet Address gives you access to your cameras web user interface. P2P Menu: The P2P access allows you to access your camera´s live video stream via our iOS or Android app. Simply scan the P2P QR code with our app and confirm the settings - done!

The camera´s http port might have to be changed to access your cameras webUI over the internet. The RTSP port is the camera´s RTSP streaming port. Set the Network Configuration: You can set whether the camera will be assigned an IP address by your router (DHCP) or, if you want to manually set a fixed address. Please check here on how to set a fixed IP address. In general, we recommend that you deactivate the automatic service and set a manual IP to avoid further trouble with the remote access to your camera. For the RTSP Port please refer to RTSP Streaming for details on the use of the camera´s RTSP videostream. Remember to forward the RTSP Port if you want to access the RTSP Stream over the internet with your DDNS Address. The RTMP Port is used by the Flash plugin in your camera´s web user interface.Remember to forward the RTMP Port (alongside your LAN Port!) if you want to access the web user interface over the internet with your DDNS Address. IP Address: This is the IPv4 address of your camera isnide your local network. To access your camera´s web user interface, simply type in the IP address into the address bar of web browser. If your camera´s LAN port is not 80, please add the port to the IP address seperated by a : , like 192.168.1.125:8081. Subnetmask: The subnet mask defines the subnet your camera is connected to. It is 255.255.255.0 in most small networks. Gateway: The gateway is the connection between your local network and the internet. In most small networks it is the IP address of your router - e.g. 192.168.1.1, 192.168.2.1 or 192.168.178.1. DNS Server: The DNS server is needed by your camera to resolve internet addresses. In most small networks it is the IP address of your router - e.g. 192.168.1.1, 192.168.2.1 or 192.168.178.1. LAN Port: The LAN Port is the HTTP Port of your camera. Add this port to your camera´s IP address, if you want to access the web user interface with your web browser. This is also the port that you need to forward inside your router, to access your camera via it´s DDNS Address. We recommend that you use a HTTP port that is higher then 8080. RTMP (Flash) Port: The RTMP Port is the video streaming port for the Flash Video Plugin. Please forward this port if you want to access the web user interface over the internet. You do not need to forward the port to access your camera over our smartphone app! RTSP Authentification active: If you want to use a streaming software like VLC Player to access the RTSP Stream, you have the option to deactivate the need to authenticate. The stream will become freely available on your network. Please make sure that authentication is active before forwarding the RTSP port! RTSP Port: The RTSP Stream of your camera runs over the RTSP Port. Make sure that the port is forwarded inside your router, if you want to access it over your cameras DDNS Address.",

Or use the scan results to check the signal strenght at the camera´s installation spot. Connect to your WiFi Network. Password Guidelines: The WiFi password is limited to max. 63 characters and may not contain the following special characters. Search Manual: Please click on Search to let your camera search for wireless networks. Select your WiFi from the list below, add your WiFi key and Submit. After confirmation, simply unplug the Ethernet cable and your camera will connect to the WiFi network. Alternatively, type in the network parameter manually. Network Type: Choose if you want to connect your camera directly to another network device (ad hoc). Or if you want to add it to the local WiFi network of your wireless router (infra). Authentication Encryption: Choose the encryption standard that your router is using. We recommend that you set your router to use pure WPA2 (AES or CCMP) and not WPA+WPA2 (TKIP). Type of Encryption: Set the type of encryption to the same encryption that your router is using. We recommend to set your WiFi router to use the AES standard. In case of an AVM Fritzbox, select CCMP and couple it with AES inside your camera. WiFi Key: Here you need to add the WiFi key that you use to connect devices to your local wireless network. The WiFi can sometimes be found on a sticker directly on the router itself. If you cannot use the WPS service (Wireless Portected Setup) to integrate the camera into you local WiFi network - see included flyer Plug & Play for further information for the WPS function - click search to start the WLAN scanner. Just choose your own network and click “Join”. Now you just have to add the WiFi password (WLAN Key) and click submit to save the settings. Afterwards you can use the Test function to verify your settings. Please disconnect the LAN cable and restart the camera (simply unplug the power supply for 3 seconds). The camera will automatically - within max. 5 minutes - connect to your WiFi network. The cameras WiFi module will receive a new address from your router - in case you didn’t assign a static IP address to your camera yet. You might have to use the INSTAR Camera Tool again to rediscover your camera. Your camera is now connected via WiFi! Attention: Your WiFi modules MAC address is not identical with the LAN MAC address of your camera! In case you are using a MAC filtering rule for your WiFi network please deactivate the filter and add your camera to the list of trusted devices before reactivating it. Additional Remark: Your camera supports a range of encryption standards - we recommend for your safety and reliability of your connection, that you set your WiFi network to WPA2 (PSK) with AES (or CCMP). With older routers choose WPA (PSK) AES. Avoid using a mixed mode like WPA&WPA2 - TKIP! If your WiFi stays unstable please choose a fixed WiFi channel for your router - we recommend the channels 1 - 6.",

You DDNS access doesn´t work? Check the DDNS status (has to be successful) and the UPnP Status (most likely has to be deactivated). You can also try accessing your camera via it´s WAN IP (instead of DDNS address) - to check wether it is the DDNS address or your port forwarding that is the culprit. Date & Time Menu: Your camera will automatically contact a so-called NTP Server to set the internal clock. It is recommended to leave this feature on at all times. But if your camera cannot connect to the internet, you can synchronize the clock with your computer. But be aware that this has to be done regularly to keep your camera on-time. User Menu: Your camera will be set up with 3 user classes - administrator, user and visitor - and one password for all of them - instar. Please change this as soon as you want to forward your camera to the internet. And don´t forget to change all three of them. You can use the RTSP Stream if you want to allow users to access your camera without the hassle of a password. STATUS LED Menu: Did you notice the blue and blinking LED on the camera? It can be very annoying in a dark room. But it can be used to troubleshoot your network connection or to make people aware that they are being recorded.

Check the DDNS status (has to be successful) and the UPnP Status (most likely has to be deactivated). You can also try accessing your camera via it´s WAN IP (instead of DDNS address) - to check wether it is the DDNS address or your port forwarding that is the culprit. Keep an Eye on your Camera´s Operation. Camera ID: Model number of your camera. Firmware Version: Version of your camera´s operating system. You can always find the newest version of the Firmware WebUI in our Download Area. The software is uploaded to your camera through the Update Menu. WebUI Version: Version of your camera´s web user interface. You can always find the newest version of the Firmware WebUI in our Download Area. The software is uploaded to your camera through the Update Menu. Network Interface: Displays whether your camera is connected by WiFi or Ethernet cable. MAC Address: Hardware identification of the active (LAN or WLAN) network interface. SD Status: Displays if your camera´s SD card is ready for operation and it´s remaining capacity (the SD card is used as a ring buffer - the oldest folder is deleted once the capacity is reached). IR LED Status: Operating mode of your nightvision LEDs - either switched on automatically (when it is getting dark) or permanently deactivated. WAN IP Address: Wide Area Network Address of your internet connection. This is the address that your DDNS Address will be translated to, to make your camera availabe from the internet (needs a Port Forwarding!). DDNS Status: This function checks if your DDNS Address was successfully updated with your actual WAN IP Address. This is a requirement to ccess your camera from the internet. UPnP Status: The UPnP service automatically tries to set a Port Forwarding for the DDNS access to your camera. We recommend to deactivate this service and create a manual forwarding instead.

Activate Summer Time: Activate or deactivate Daylight-Saving Time - please be aware, that switched on, this setting will not automatically be deactivated in winter! NTP Server: If you run into problems with the automatic synchronization, you can try a different internet time server from this list. Closed company networks might need to set an internal NTP server - this can be done wth a CGI Command. NTP Update Intervall: Set the interval you want your camera to use for the time synchronization. You can set up the internal clock of the camera to be either synchronised with your PC clock or with one of several NTP servers. As long as your camera has access to the internet it is recommended to use an NTP server synchronisation to achieve a higher accuracy for alarm trigger events.

Please be adviced that high quality settings come with high requirements for your computer hardware and network bandwidth. Adjust the video quality to obtain a fluent video accordingly. Please refer to RTSP Streaming for accessing the cameras streams 2 and 3. Adjust the Video Settings. Activate MJPEG Stream: Your camera is able to send the video, instead of an h.264 encoded stream, in form of a sequence of single snapshots. This Motion-JPEG Stream has the advantage, that it can be displayed in every web browser without the need for a video plugin. This is necessary if you want to see the live video on a computer where you don´t have the rights to install a browser plugin, e.g. your company PC. The disadvantage of this mode is that the compression is a lot weaker and you will need a lot more bandwidth. You can quickly activate deactivate the mode with the quick toggle in the Video Menu Bar.Video Channel: Your camera can send it´s h.264 video in form of three different streams, with different resolution. You can access all three of them independently with external software. Selecting a stream here defines which stream is displayed inside the web user interface. Video Resolution: Displays the resolution of the selected video stream. The video resolution is defined by the Video Channel that you choose above. E.g. the first channel is always streamed in 720p HD resolution. Video Framerate: This value represents the frames per seconds that you want your to stream. Please be aware that this is only a theoretical maximum that you don´t want your camera to exceed. The actual framerate might be bottlenecked by your camera´s network connection and the exposure time of the image sensor (the darker the image becomes, the longer the image sensor has to collect light and the longer it takes to create a frame). The framerate is suitable to set an upper limit to the bandwidth requirement of your camera, to prevent a network overload. The default value of 15 fps is usually a workable compromise for most surveillance tasks. Video Bitrate: The bitrate determines how many information can be packed into the video stream. Increasing the bitrate will massively increase the bandwidth requirements for accessing the stream over the local network and will also increase the file size of recorded videos. A significant advantage in image quality will only be achieved, if the video contains a lot of fine details. In most cases it is recommended to leave this value at it´s default of 1024-2048kbps. Video Encoding: You can adjust if you want to hold the set bitrate, or if you want your camera to automatically use a lower bitrate if the video is low in details (e.g. your camera can often work with a much lower bitrate during the night). This will effect the file size of recorded videos, the processor load of your camera, as well as the bandwidth requirements of the live stream. We recommend that you use the variable Bitrate. Image Quality: Set the JPG quality of each frame that will be used for the h.264 video. You will get the best results using a value of 3. Keyframe Interval: A key frame (I-Frame) is a frame encoded in its entirety, much like a JPEG image. P-frames are predicted, ie, they contain only the changes from frame to frame. Hence I frames are typically 10x larger than P frames, so the fewer you have, the more compression you can get. As a compromise between image quality and bandwidth requirement, it is recommended to create about 1 keyframe every second. With the default intervall of 20 frames and a framerate of 15fps, your camera will send an I-Frame every (20 Frames 15 Frames s) = 1.33s. h.264 Video Plugin: Here you can choose the video plugin the web user interface uses to diplay the h.264 videostream. The default plugin is Flash. The Quicktime Player or our ActiveX Player can be chooses alternatively. The ActiveX Plugin can only be used under Windows with the Internet Explorer or Firefox Browser, but offers few adavantages over the other plugins. In general we recommend the use of the Flash Plugin. MotionJPEG Video Mode: If you are using the MJPEG stream, you can choose between two modes - a real MJPEG Stream (recommended) and a simulated Stream that is created by letting your browser request a new snapshot for each frame. I am not sure what the latter is for - but it is always nice to have it :) The video settings allow you to adjust the quality of all 3 videostreams of your camera. Please be adviced that high quality settings come with high requirements for your computer hardware and network bandwidth. Adjust the video quality to obtain a fluent video accordingly. Please refer to RTSP Streaming for accessing the cameras streams 2 and 3.",

    "description": "Alarm Menu - Areas Menu: The alarm areas detect motion by a picture analysis that is sensitive to every change inside the video frame instead of employing an infrared or microwave sensor. You can setup up to 4 detection areas - just activate an area and draw it’s shape onto the image - and adjusts it´s sensitivity to set a threshold for trigger events. Once the motion detection in an area is activated, its sensitivity can be adjusted from very insensitive (value=0) to very sensitive (value=100). Privacy Mask Menu: The Privacy Mask Menu allows you to black out areas from your surveillance. E.g. you can still see a part of the public street in front of your house on your surveillance videos. But you can not adjust the camera angle any more. Now you can setup up to 4 masks to prevent the street from showing up in your surveillance footage - just activate an area and draw it’s shape onto the image. Actions Menu: Adjust the cameras behaviour in case of a motion alert trigger event. You can set the camera to send you an email and to save snapshots or videos on your SD card. Please make sure you set your SMTP Server settings before activating the email notification and that you have a SD card in your cameras SDHC card slot (max. 32 GB) to use the video recording and send-to-FTP function - a 4 GB SD card is included in the delivery. Schedule Menu: Here you can define a time schedule in which the motion detection should be active for the active detection areas. Every blue square represents 30 minutes of armed motion detection. Please make sure to set the correct time zone as it will be used by the camera. Remember Daylight-Saving-Time! SMTP Server Menu: Simply use the INSTAR Preset if you don´t know the SMTP information of your Email provider. Choose the preset from the drop down menu and confirm. The Email recipient can be set in the Email Menu. Set-up this way, your camera will use an INSTAR Server to send alarm mails to your personal Email address. This transfer will be TLS encrypted and INSTAR does not store any copies of your Emails! Email Menu: Here you need to input the sender, the receivers, the subject as well as optional a short email text with a maximum 64 characters. The sender address should be in accordance with the SMTP server settings, though some email provider let you choose this field freely. If you want to send the email to more than one address, simply separate the addresses with a semicolon ;. E.g. max.mustermann@instar.de ; franz.fingerhut@instar.de. It is recommended to fill out the subject line and the email text body to avoid the mail to be caught by any spam guards in place. FTP Menu: To use the video FTP Upload you first have to set your ftp server address and login credentials. E.g. you can use your routers FTP service as FTP Server - in this case simply put in your routers IP as the FTP Server address. If you set up a FTP server on a local PC (for example with Filezilla Server), use the PC’s local IP address. Of course you can use webservers URL’s as well. The standard FTP port is 21. Audio Alarm Menu: The camera’s Audio Alarm uses the integrated microphone to detect noises and trigger alarm events. These events are handled just like motion detection events and will trigger the activated Alarm Actions. Please be aware that the sensitivity of the detection is both influenced by the sensitivity slider here, as well as by the overall volume of the microphone signal. You can adjust the amplification of the signal in the Multimedia Section. SD Card Menu: Please check the corresponding box and click submit to either format or unmount your SD card. It is recommended to always unmount your SD card before removing it from your camera! Your SD card might be unavailable after an unexpected restart. Please wait for the operating system to check the file system for errors. The SD card will show up again once it was successfuly mounted by the system.",

Once the motion detection in an area is activated, its sensitivity can be adjusted from very insensitive (value=0) to very sensitive (value=100). Set Motion Detection Areas. Areas: Klicken Sie auf den Radio Button hinter dem Bereich (1-4) den Sie bearbeiten möchten. Bewegen Sie danach Ihren Mauszeiger über das Bild Ihrer Kamera, halten Sie die linke Maustaste gedrückt und ziehen Sie ein Rechteck über dem Bild auf. Um einen zweiten Bereich aufzuziehen, wählen Sie den entsprechenden Bereich aus und wiederholen die weiteren Schritte. Die Bewegungserkennung der Kamera wird danach nur innerhalb dieser Bereiche nach Bewegungen suchen. Active: Der Haken hinter Aktiv aktiviert den entsprechenden Bereich. D.h. die Kamera beginnt innerhalb dieses Bereiches nach Bewegungen zu suchen und wird bei einer positiven Erkennung, die von Ihnen gewählten Alarmaktionen auslösen. In der Menüleiste über dem Livevideo finden Sie einen Shortcut um die einzelnen Bereich schnell zu aktivieren deaktivieren, ohne das Bereiche Menü aufrufen zu müssen. Sobald eine der Zahlen 1-4 rot dargestellt wird, ist der zugehörige Bereich aktiv. Sensitivity: Legen Sie hier fest, wie viele Pixel sich im Bild ändern müssen um eine Alarmaktion auszulösen. Umso höher die Empfindlichkeit ist, desto weniger muss sich im Bildinhalt verändern um einen Alarm auszulösen. Beachten Sie bitte, dass die Empfindlichkeit auch von der Größe des Bereiches abhängt. Ein Objekt, dass 100 Pixel im Videobild ein nimmt, nimmt prozentual eine größere Fläche in einem kleinen Bereich ein, als in einem großen Bereich. Wenn Sie zu viele Fehlalarme erhalten, versuchen Sie die Bereiche größer einzuzeichnen. Wenn Ihnen die Erkennung zu unempfindlich ist, zeichnen Sie kleinere Bereiche im Bild ein. All: Klicken Sie auf diesen Button um den ausgewählten Bereich über dem ganzen Bild aufzuspannen. Reset: Bewegen Sie den ausgewählten Bereich wieder in seine Ausgangsposition. Define Areas that will be used for the Motion Detection. The alarm areas detect motion by a picture analysis that is sensitive to every change inside the video frame instead of employing an infrared or microwave sensor. You can setup up to 4 detection areas - just activate an area and draw it’s shape onto the image - and adjusts it´s sensitivity to set a threshold for trigger events. Once the motion detection in an area is activated, its sensitivity can be adjusted from very insensitive (value=0) to very sensitive (value=100). Wrong: Many small Alarm Areas distributed over the Frame. The smaller an area, the bigger (in percent) a change in the image will be. Small areas are a lot more sensitive and should be used over parts of the image, where you never want to miss someone walking through. But they also lead to a large number of false alerts und should be used sparsely. You will receive a lot of false alarm notifications in the example above. Right: One big Area - small Areas only where they are critical. A big area is - according to the explanation above - much more resistent against false alerts. A big area over the whole image will only trigger an alert when a person comes very close to the camera. You can use a slightly higher sensitivity to compensate. To prevent that you might loose actual alarm events, add a smaller area where it is critical - e.g. a window or your front door. The smaller this area is is, the higher it´s sensitivity. To find the optimal setting, keep an eye on your camera´s System Log. If an area cause too many false alerts, make it bigger or decrease it´s sensitivity. Potential Errors: In case the camera’s position is prone to rapid light changes, e.g. changes in sun intensity due to cloud movements, you might be confronted with a high number of false alarms. In this case please refer to Actions Menu for employing a PIR motion detector.",

Software-based Motion Detection. The software-based motion detection used by your camera for the activated Alarm Areas does not need any additional hardware to work and can be very precise in controlled indoor environments. The disadvantage is that the detection does not discriminate causes for changes inside the cameras field of view - a cloud moving by in front of the sun, raindrops or vegetation moving in the wind. Everything can cause an alarm. Use an external Sensor. You can use a motion detector like the IN-Motion 500 to improve the detection rate of your camera (Only cameras with an Alarm-In contact) if your camera does not yet come with a PIR motion sensor equipped like the IN-6014 HD. Simply connect the sensor to the alarm input and activate the external input. The camera will trigger an alarm when the pins 3&4 are bridged and the relay state is set to closed on alarm (n.o. “Normally Open”). If it is set to open on alarm, the alarm will be triggered once the circuit is broken by the relay inside the detector (n.c. “Normally Closed”) or if the wire is disconnected. The state you have to choose depends on your sensor - the wrong choice will give a continuous alert once the detector is connected. Remark: When you are using an external sensor (or the internal PIR sensor in case of the IN-6014 HD), then you have to either deactivate the internal motion detection (Alarm Areas) or have to couple it with the Alarm Input! The alarm cannot be triggered otherwise. Once you coupled both detection methods, you always have to deactivate both to deactivate the motion detection! Use the internal Sensor (IN-6014 HD). Activating the internal or external PIR sensor allows you to limit the motion detection to bodies whose temperature differs from the background. In most cases, this will be a person or animal in front of the cameras or the warm motor of a car. Changes in light conditions, fog in front of the camera at night or movements in the wind will not be detected by the PIR sensor. By coupling the PIR sensor with the detection areas, you will only get an alarm event if both detection methods were triggered at the same time. This will greatly reduce the number of false alerts you might have. But be aware that it also might eliminate a few positive alerts. Switch external devices in case of an alarm (or manually). The external output connects to a relay inside the camera that can be switched manually or automatically in case of an alarm event. Please check Activate External Output to let the camera open or close a circuit with an external device connected to the pins 1&2. The external output can be used with the cameras motion detection to activate signalling devices like sirens or LED lights. It can also be used to control connected devices manually, e.g. via our smartphone app. The relay can be connected to circuits with up to 60 V direct current 125 V alternating current and max. 1 A.",

With some systems you might run into some problems with this setting. In this case try to upload all files to one folder instead. Test: The test function will try to upload a file to your FTP server - the name of the file consists of the capital letter T and a Timestamp. Don´t forget to submit your settings first before using the Test Function! FTP Server Upload: To use the video FTP Upload you first have to set your ftp server address and login credentials. E.g. you can use your routers FTP service as FTP Server - in this case simply put in your routers IP as the FTP Server address. If you set up a FTP server on a local PC (for example with Filezilla Server), use the PC’s local IP address. Of course you can use webservers URL’s as well. The standard FTP port is 21. You can define an upload directory for your camera under FTP Folder. The root folder of the FTP server can be reached by. The separator for the folders is the forward slash. A subfolder (e.g. INSTAR) can be reached by INSTAR. An ending forward slash is not obligatory, but can be used. The FTP Username and FTP Password are the login credentials for your FTP Account. The name of the video file is fixed and corresponds to the following syntax: rec011_YYYYMMDDhhmmss.asf. The first part shows the channel that was used for the recording - 11, 12 or 13. Separated by an underscore follows a timestamp, which marks the time of the motion detection. Passive or Port: For the FTP Mode you can choose between a passive (PASV) and an active mode (PORT). The standard is the active PASV mode. If your server is installed behind a router with an active network address translation (NAT), or if a firewall is blocking the servers network from an external access by your camera, you should choose the PORT mode.",
