    "description": "Direct LAN Connection How to connect your camera directly with your computer via an Ethernet cable The following instructions will explain to you step by step how you can create a direct LAN connection between your computer and an INSTAR IP camera. Use this approach if you want to use the camera in an area, that does not provide a network infrastructure or to if you want to configure the camera to connect to a Wifi network when you don´t have a LAN Ethernet connection available to make the initial Wifi configuration. Connect the Camera Connect the camera with a regular Ethernet cable to your PC or Notebook(Very old PCs might still need a special - Crossover - cable to make this connections). Search the Camera Install/Open the INSTAR Camera Tool which will show you the following message after clicking the ''Search'' button:(you might have to select the correct network interface to which the camera is connected to. If for example you have a VPN connection, an active bluetooth module and the regular LAN interface, then you have to select the LAN interface in order to find your IP camera. Open the camera tool and press Search. Assign a static IP to your Windows PC Open the Network- and Sharing Centre(Control Panel ->Network and Security). The interface will show you a new unidentified LAN connection. Open it´s settings by clicking Local Area Network. Go to Properties, select the Internet Protocol Version 4(TCP/IPv4) and select Properties as shown below. Open the Windows Network- and Sharing Centre and go to the LAN adapter properties. The following window will open and allow you to set a static IP address for your PC/Laptop. Submit the settings by clicking OK and return to the IP Camera Tool. Open the IPv4 properties. Please fill in a valid IP address for your computer and set it to be new networks gateway and DNS server(see below):Assign a static IP address to your PC. Assign a static IP to your Mac Open the menu System Preferences go to Network and click on Ethernet. Please choose Configure IPv4:Manually and type in a valid IP address. Use the same IP address as the Router IP. Submit the new settings with Apply and return to the IP Camera Tool. Go to the Sytem Preferences and open the Ethernet configuration. Assign a static IP to your Camera Click on ''IP Config'' and select your camera on the left side. Fill in the IP address for the camera. The address has to be in the same IP subnet you used for your computer in '''step 3''' but has to be different from the address you choose above - e.g. '''just add 1''' to the last octet(see example below)!The Gateway and DNS server will be the IP address of your computer that you set above. If you are using a class C network the standard subnet mask is(Subnet Mask:255.255.255.0). Open the IP configuration tab of the INSTAR camera tool and set a valid IP address and submit. After submitting the data the camera will restart which takes about 30 seconds. Click on Search to find the camera again and double-click die camera entry to open the WebUI inside your default browser. If you want to use a different browser, type in the camera´s IP address into your browser´s address line and press Return. You are now able to change the camera´s settings and access the live stream. Open the camera´s new IP address with your default browser. If you choose the direct connection to do the initial WLAN configuration of your camera to integrate it into an existing Wifi network, type in the WLAN information under Network/WIFi and change the cameras IP address to a free address in the IP subnet that is used inside the wireless network. The camera will then restart - please unplug the LAN cable right after submitting the new IP address to allow the camera to connect to your wireless LAN.",

    "description": "The Angry IP Scanner Angry IP scanner is a very fast IP address and port scanner. It is cross-platform and lightweight. Not requiring any installations, it can be freely copied and used anywhere. Angry IP scanner simply pings each IP address to check if it’s alive, then optionally it is resolving its hostname, determines the MAC address, scans ports, etc. Alternative IP Scanner How to find your IP Camera in the network with an alternative IP Scanner The IP Camera Tool(Windows), IP Camera Tool(MacOSX) or IP Camera Tool(Linux) is for sure the most comfortable way to find your IP camera inside your network. Instructions on how to set up your INSTAR IP camera with the Camera Tool can be found here. If, for some reason, the IP Camera Tool does not work on your computer, here are a few other options to discover the IP address. The camera will try to receive an IP address automatically(DHCP) during the first installation. Most routers will give you a log file of fresh DHCP requests, in which you should be able to find the camera´s IP address. You should reach the cameras login portal by typing this address into the web browser´s address bar. If you do not have access to your router or if your router does not have any log files please refer to alternative IP scanners - an examples is:Angry IP Scanner(Windows/MacOSX/Linux) You can find the newest Version here for Windows/MacOSX/Linux - install and start the application, type in the IP range and start the search. Please fill out the field IP Range with the IP range that your router´s DHCP service is set to. If you do not know the IP range, then simply use the command line on Windows, type in ipconfig and check your computers IPv4 address(see screenshot below). Use this IP address in Angry IP Scanner and just change the last octet to 1 for the start IP address and 254 for the last IP address to search the complete /24 subnet. Make sure your camera is disconnected from your network and then press Start to begin the scan. You can use the ipconfig command to confirm the IP range of your network. The scanner will now display all active devices in your network(marked in blue as shown below). In the case below we have 5 active devices. The scan reveals that there are 5 active devices inside the given IP range. Now connect your camera to your router and re-run the scan. The scanner will display a new network device with the hostname ipcamera (only VGA cameras). If the Angry IP scanner does not resolve the hostname, it under Tools - Fetchers. If you are using more then one camera in your network we recommend, you only connect one camera at a time in order to differentiate them. If you are unsure which host is the camera, unplug the camera and re-scan the network. The now missing entry will reveal the cameras IP address. Once you discovered your camera´s IP address, simply copy the address by right-clicking on it and paste it into your web browsers address bar and press the Return button. Copy the IP address and paste it into your browsers address bar to load the cameras web user interface. You will now be greeted by the camera´s login page - the default credentials are username admin and the password can be left blank(or type in instar in case of a HD camera model). Congratulations!You now entered the cameras Web User Interface.",

    "description": "Wireless First steps to set up a Wifi connection Please be aware that the camera has to be installed via LAN cable first before it can be used in your wireless network - see First Steps. Please use the included Ethernet cable to connect the camera with your router. After the camera is connected, please open the web interface of your IP camera in your default web browser. Connect the WiFi antenna to the SMA/RP-SMA on camera (only for models with removable antenna), align it vertically to your router and place the camera close to your Wifi router for the rest of the installation process. Connect the antenna to your indoor camera. Connect the antenna to your outdoor camera. HD Cameras ATTENTION: Please make sure the password does not include any special characters such as ... Please make sure that the MAC Filter function is not activated in your router. The cameras LAN module has a different MAC address then the Wifi board. If you are using the Wifi access control of your router, please deactivate it, let the camera connect and add the new MAC address to the list of trusted devices before reactivating the filter. If you have trouble connecting to the network try setting the router´s Wifi channel to channel 6 or a channel which is not being used by routers nearby. If you have the camera set to use the DHCP service be aware that it will receive a new IP address because the MAC address for the Wifi board is different from the LAN MAC address. Simply open the INSTAR camera tool to reconnect to the camera. We recommend using a static IP address if you are having difficulties connecting to the wireless network. You can set a static IP in the web user interface in Network/IP configuration. If you are using a WEP 128 Bit encryption and you encounter any problems, we recommend you to switch your encryption to WPA (AES) or WPA2 (AES or CCMP). Also avoid mixed modes like WPA/WPA2 (TKIP). Step 1: Please open the menu Network/Wifi as shown below. Open the Wifi menu in the web user interface. Step 2: Click on the Search button to activate the Wifi module and let the camera search for active 2.4GHz networks in it´s environment. Use the camera´s search function to discover available 2.4GHz Wifi networks. Step 3: Choose your Wifi network from the list and press the Join button to copy the network´s details into the cameras Wifi settings. Select your network from the list and press Join. Step 4: Now simply add your Wifi password and confirm your input. Pressing the Submit button will save the information and allow you to Test the connection. To connect the camera to your wireless network, unplug the Ethernet cable and restart it. The camera will automatically connect to your wireless network and receive a new IP address from your router by DHCP (if activated).

    "description": "Display your Cameras Video inside your Browser. Video Plugins: All INSTAR HD cameras can display their video stream inside a modern web browser (like Firefox, Chrome or Edge) without the need for a video plugin. Just activate the MJPEG mode for this - e.g. in the Multimedia/Video Menu of your 720p camera. But you will loose the h.264 video compression and might start to suffer from bandwidth bottlenecks inside your network. We hightly recommend, that you should install the Flash Video Plugin and use the h.264 videostream instead. This plugin is already installed on most systems and your camera is configured to use it by default - you should be able to see the video stream at once, after loading your cameras web user interface. Other Options: If for some reason you cannot use the Flash Video Plugin, there are three more options to display the video stream inside a web browser. You can use the Quick Time Plugin, an ActiveX Plugin (only works with Internet Explorer and Firefox) that comes with a couple of perks or use the above mentioned MJPEG mode to avoid using plugins all together. ActiveX Plugin -  Windows video plugin (IE and FF). QuickTime Plugin - Plugin for Windows and macOS. MJPEG Mode - Use this mode in Microsoft Edge. Troubleshooting The video plugin might be blocked by your Firewall or Virus scanner. The following articles will explain how to set up your security software to unblock it. Avast Internet Security, Kaspersky 2013, Kaspersky 2014, AVG Internet Security, AVIRA Antivirus Pro, F-Secure Security.",
